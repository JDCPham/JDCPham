### Hello 👋

I'm John and I live in a city called London. My parents are originally from Vietnam but emigrated here in search of a better future for myself and my sister. I recently graduated from King's College London with a degree in Computer Science and am currently working in the banking and finance industry. 

- 💼 I've just started my new role at HSBC and am undergoing an intensive technical training program until the end of the year!
- 🛩 I've always wanted to become a pilot. My biggest wish is to take flying lessons and get my Private Pilot's License.
- 🎓 I graduated from King's College London with a First Class Honours degree in Computer Science. For my final-year project, I researched and implemented software to visualise and analyse congestion algorithms on the internet.
- 🎹 I started playing the piano from the age of 8 and studied at the Royal Academy of Music for 4 years. I've now achieved my grade 8 certification!
